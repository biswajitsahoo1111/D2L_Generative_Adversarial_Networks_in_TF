# Tensorflow 2 code for D2L book's Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) chapter
This repository contains `Tensorflow 2` code for Generative Adversarial Networks chapter of [Dive into Deep Learning (D2L)](http://d2l.ai/) book. The chapter has 2 sections and code for each section can be found at the following links.

[17.1. Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/biswajitsahoo1111/D2L_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_in_TF/blob/master/17_1_Generative_Adversarial_Networks.ipynb)

[17.2. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/biswajitsahoo1111/D2L_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_in_TF/blob/master/17_2_Deep_Convolutional_Generative_Adversarial_Networks.ipynb)

### Additional Chapters:

Chapter 10: [Attention Mechanisms](https://github.com/biswajitsahoo1111/D2L_Attention_Mechanisms_in_TF) 

### How to run these code:

The best way (in our opinion) is to either clone the repo (or download the zipped repo) and then run each notebook from the cloned (or extracted) folder. All the notebooks will run without any issue.

**Note**: We claim no originality for the code. Credit goes to the authors of this excellent [book](http://d2l.ai/). However, all errors and omissions are my own and readers are encouraged to bring it to my notice. Finally, no TF code was available (to the best of my knowledge) for `Attention Mechanisms` chapter when this repo was first made public.
